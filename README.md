This dataset contains wind condition and flight process data totaling over 46 hours from 270 flights involving three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The dataset covers flight data under various scenario settings, including constant altitude and speed, constant altitude with variable speed, variable altitude with constant speed, variable altitude with variable speed , random flight, and multi-UAV flight in same time. This dataset holds significant value for researching the adaptability of UAVs in changing scenarios and tasks, as well as key AI issues such as sim-2-real transfer.

# Flight Data
## Flight Data Statistics
We categorize and store various flight data in different folders according to different flight scenarios. Specifically, the FAFS folder contains data from drones flying at a fixed altitude and speed; the FAVS folder stores data from drones flying at a fixed altitude but with varying speeds; the VAFS folder holds data from drones flying at varying altitudes but with a fixed speed; the VAVS folder preserves data from drones flying at varying altitudes and speeds; and the Random folder keeps data from drones flying at random varying altitudes and speeds under manual control. Table below presents statistical data on the proportion of data from different scenarios, the aircraft used, flight durations, and other relevant information within the entire dataset.

Attention:The symbol "+" indicates that we will continue to supplement this type of data.

## Flight File Naming Rules
In this work, we keep the raw unprocessed acquisition data and the ready data that are directly used for the study after merging the wind speeds, which are saved in the subfolder raw_data and the subfolder with the same name as the parent folder, respectively. We summarise where these raw and ready data are saved, the naming convention, and the contents therein in in table below.

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

# Flight Route
This dataset's flights involve a total of five different routes, and the aerial views and 3D simulations of these routes are stored in the "Route" folder.

# Absolute Wind
In the "wind" folder, we have recorded the absolute wind condition information for the collection days, providing users with real-world environmental references. This is distinct from the relative wind condition information in the data files, which was collected during the UAV's flight along the reference trajectory at different speeds. Absolute wind conditions refer to wind data collected while the UAV is hovering at a fixed altitude. In this folder, we differentiate the absolute wind condition data from different collection days using the naming convention: \[UAV Name\]\_wind\_\[Collection Time\]_\[Collection Altitude\].csv. The "Collection Altitude" indicates the height at which the UAV hovered during data collection. For example, "102040" signifies that the UAV hovered at 10m, 20m, and 40m, while "20" indicates that the UAV only hovered at 20m to collect wind conditions.
